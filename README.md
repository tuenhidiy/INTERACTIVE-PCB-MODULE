# INTERACTIVE-PCB-MODULE
INTERACTIVE MODULE 8x8 is designed on printed circuit board. By doing this way, we can combine some INTERACTIVE MODULE 8x8 together to get a big interactive led table. We can also save a lot of time and the circuit works more stable, minimizing noises compared to soldering copper wires to each component.
